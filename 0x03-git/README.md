# Using Git and Github
Practising with **Git** and **Github**. Tracking file changes, adding or
staging file changes, committing and pushing to remote repository.
Also advanced tasks like branching. I created a new branch "update_script" made changes to files on it pushed the changes to the
branch "update_script". Made changes also to files on the master
branch.Then lastly tried to merge bracnch "update_script" into Master branch.
Creating a .gitignore file to add files to be ignored by git using filename, path or wildcards.
